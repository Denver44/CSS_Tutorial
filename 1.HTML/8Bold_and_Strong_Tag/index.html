    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p>
      A <b> computer </b> is a machine that can be instructed to carry out
      sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer
      programming. <strong>Modern computers </strong> have the ability to follow
      generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable
      computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete"
      computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and
      peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be
      referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a
      group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a
      computer network or computer cluster.
