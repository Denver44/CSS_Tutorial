    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p>
      A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of
      arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
      Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of
      operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform
      an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
      hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
      required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer
      system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are
      connected and work together, in particular a computer network or
      computer cluster.

      More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog
      calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
      calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first
      semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the
      silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit
      (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s.
